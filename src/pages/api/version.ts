/**
 * GET /api/version
 *
 * Returns the version baked into this Worker bundle. The /admin/update
 * polling loop uses this to detect when a new build has rolled out:
 * the value changes the moment Cloudflare swaps in the new isolate
 * after the GitHub App sync commit triggers a Cloudflare rebuild.
 *
 * Auth is enforced by the global middleware — the endpoint is only
 * called from the locked /admin/update page so the admin session is
 * always present.
