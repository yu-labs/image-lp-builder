/**
 * Public host resolution.
 *
 * The Worker is reachable on at least two URLs at any given time:
 *
 *   - {worker-name}.{account}.workers.dev — always, free, the URL the
 *     self-hoster gets the moment they click "Deploy to Cloudflare".
 *   - lp.{self-hoster-domain}                  — once they wire a custom
 *     domain on the site-settings page (and bind it in the CF
 *     dashboard).
 *
 * Pretty much every "where do I link to / what's the canonical URL"
 * question in the codebase reduces to:
 *
 *   "Given the request that just came in and the row in site_meta,
 *    what host *should* this LP advertise?"
 *
 * Centralising the answer here keeps the rule consistent across the
 * public LP page, OGP/canonical tags, the QR / share-URL builders in
 * the admin UI, the workers.dev kill-switch redirect, and the
 * robots.txt / forced-noindex logic that ships alongside this helper.
 *
 * The rule itself is small and worth stating once:
 *
 *   - site_meta.domain set       -> lp.{domain} is canonical, regardless
 *                                   of which host the request hit.
 *   - site_meta.domain unset     -> whatever host the request hit is
 *                                   canonical (workers.dev URL stays
 *                                   indexable until the self-hoster wires
 *                                   their own domain).
